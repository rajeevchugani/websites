	<h1>Nested Selectors in CSS</h1>

	<p>Often, we may find ourselves wanting to style things <em>differently</em> depending on their <em>context</em>.</p>

	<p>The &lt;em&gt; tag is used in the html structure to signal some text that css should emphasise. The default css for most browsers is to make it <em>italic</em> but you can override it in your own stylesheet with em{ }.</p>

	<p>But what if we want to quote a block of text which also emphasizes something?</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>
			This is a quote from some famous person who undoubtedly has something <em>very important</em> to say.
		</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>
		If we want our block quote to be set in italics by default, then the visual style for emphasis needs to be different, <em>but only when inside a blockquote</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is where <em>nested selectors</em> come in handy.
