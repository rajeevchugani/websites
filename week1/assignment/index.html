	<p>Hey! I'm Jeev. I like to eat, take photos, play football and dance. I recently created this website to put together the journey of food (mainly in Hong Kong), and would like to share my experiences with all of you.</p>

	<p>I graduated from University College London with a degree in biomedical sceinces but during my time in the UK, i discovered my taste palate. I currently live in Hong Kong, working as a haematologist. Food is a massive hobby of mine.</p>

	<p>I've documented my food through instagram since getting it back in 2007, and this blog has been an extension of that. most of my posts include new restaurants, recipes as well as photos and documentations of places visited.</p>
